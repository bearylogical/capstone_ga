      "Ms Irene Quay Siew Ching asked the Minister for Education with regard to the post-Secondary admission system to be implemented in 2028 (a) how does the new subject banding determine subsequent admission to post-Secondary institutions of choice; and (b) how can it be ensured that a student chooses subject bands based on his ability and talent and not influenced primarily by entry criteria of his favoured post-Secondary institutions.<br/>The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Education): Mr Speaker, as announced earlier during the COS debate, MOE will study how the post-Secondary posting system should be adjusted to complement the roll-out of Full SBB.We have some time to work out the details, and will announce them in good time. But the general thrust is to build upon ongoing efforts to recognise the strengths and talents of students.For example, we have the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) today, where students who have done well in the Normal (Academic) course can apply straight to Polytechnic. The core feature of PFP is to inject flexibility into the posting system, recognising the fact that students blossom at different times and have different strengths. In future, under \"one Secondary education, many subject bands\", such considerations should not be just for special schemes like PFP, but an integral feature of the posting system.In a similar vein, we will also study how we can further evolve the Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) for Polytechnics and ITE, and Direct School Admissions (DSA) for JCs.To help students make informed post-Secondary choices, students go through education and career guidance (ECG) in secondary school to help them better understand their strengths and interests. Teachers and ECG counsellors guide students to explore different education pathways, different industries and job roles.Full SBB and expanding aptitude-based admissions are part of the multiple pathways that we are creating to better cater to students with different interests and learning needs. We will keep evolving our education system to ensure that students are able to choose their subjects bands and PSEIs based on what best fits their aptitudes and interests.\n",

But the general thrust is to build upon ongoing efforts to recognise the strengths and talents of students.For example, we have the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) today, where students who have done well in the Normal (Academic) course can apply straight to Polytechnic. The core feature of PFP is to inject flexibility into the posting system, recognising the fact that students blossom at different times and have different strengths. In future, under \"one Secondary education, many subject bands\", such considerations should not be just for special schemes like PFP, but an integral feature of the posting system.In a similar vein, we will also study how we can further evolve the Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) for Polytechnics and ITE, and Direct School Admissions (DSA) for JCs.To help students make informed post-Secondary choices, students go through education and career guidance (ECG) in secondary school to help them better understand their strengths and interests. Teachers and ECG counsellors guide students to explore different education pathways, different industries and job roles.Full SBB and expanding aptitude-based admissions are part of the multiple pathways that we are creating to better cater to students with different interests and learning needs.

       "\"<p>11 <strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for National Development (a) in the past three years, how many summons have been issued to offenders who feed pigeons; and (b) what other measures can the Ministry introduce to deter the feeding of pigeons.</p><p><strong>\\tThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for National Development)</strong>:&nbsp;Over the past three years, 682 enforcement notices were issued for pigeon feeding offences.&nbsp;NParks takes measures to deter the feeding of pigeons, including installing cameras and conducting surveillance at identified feeding hotspots.&nbsp;NParks also works with Town Councils to put up notices to ask for information about feeding activities, so as to carry out enforcement operations in a more targeted manner.</p><p>Public education is also an important strategy.&nbsp;NParks, NEA and the Town Councils work together to educate residents about the environmental health and hygiene issues caused by pigeon feeding.&nbsp;This is done through advisories, posters and outreach events.&nbsp;Agencies are also working with the Municipal Services Office to develop targeted public education messages and materials. The community and grassroots leaders can also help to spread the message.</p><p>To reduce the availability of food sources for pigeons, NEA ensures good food waste management in food centres and coffee shops in HDB estates and enforces against littering. Residents can and should also play their part by helping to maintain the overall cleanliness of their estates.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>: I have had many complaints about pigeons at hawker centres, at window ledges, at everywhere. And the bird droppings, I understand, are considered to be infectious. So, I am asking the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, can NParks do more to step up enforcement. Following what hon Member Mr Louis Ng said, can there be more manpower given to NParks to enforce more, step more patrols, do more advisories, because when the Town Council talks to the residents, many at time, they are ignored? So, there should be greater enforcement to send the signal that feeding of pigeons is not something that is legal. Would Senior Parliamentary Secretary also consider increasing the penalties for pigeon feeding? I think the message has not gotten to many of these pigeon feeders that whatever they are doing is causing health risks to many other people?</p><p><strong>\\tMs Sun Xueling</strong>: I thank the Member for his two points.&nbsp;Firstly, I would encourage perhaps the Member to share with us where the hotspots are because I think that would be very helpful in allowing us to concentrate our manpower or the use of cameras and targeted patrols. Because if we know when the pigeon feeder normally comes out, it is easier for us to catch the pigeon feeder in action. So, I think information such as this from residents, from grassroots leaders and from the community will be very helpful in allowing us to be more effective in the way we conduct our enforcement.</p><p>On the second point about increasing penalties, currently, pigeon feeders can be fined up to $500 per offence. So, I think we can put more of this information out. And I would also like to share with him that there was this high-rise littering/pigeon feeding pilot in Yio Chu Kang that was actually spearheaded by one of my colleagues. On the enforcement front, not only do they deploy cameras to basically enforce and find out who the pigeon feeders are, they also put up captured images of the offenders. So, I think it is helpful in creating community awareness. And they also work with the local Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to engage vulnerable and/or recalcitrant offenders. Because while we have our fines, and we enforce when we catch – as I mentioned, they can be fined up to $500 per offence – we also find that sometimes, some of these offenders may have some other issues that they are dealing with. And if we are able to work with the community, we can also reach out to the families and friends of these offenders and see how we can deter such behaviour from them.</p><p><strong>\\tMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast)</strong>:<strong> </strong>Similarly, in my constituency, we have a lot of pigeon issues. So, I listened with great interest in the pilot that the Senior Parliamentary Secretary spoke about. All the things that Senior Parliamentary Secretary spoke about, we have attempted. And I would say, over the last eight or nine years, I do not see much results. We have done everything that she has suggested. I think the pilot that she just mentioned, I listened with great interest and I would like to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary when can this be rolled out to the other parts of Singapore.</p><p><strong>\\tMs Sun Xueling</strong>: I thank the Member for the point she raised. The pilot consists of three parts. I had mentioned enforcement earlier. It also includes community solutioning which includes putting up educational materials which I am sure the Member has attempted. But also, I guess it is really about house-to-house visits for affected blocks. But I would say that the initial results from this high-rise littering/pigeon feeding pilot in Yio Chu Kang has been quite promising. We would look into it further and see how we can roll it out to different locations. As we understand it, pigeon feeding issues are quite local-based. It depends on the local infrastructure, the demographics of the residents who live in a certain area, certain habits, and the interaction between food centres in the local community.</p><p>So, while we currently seem to have a pilot that has seemed to have worked quite well in Yio Chu Kang, I think we will probably have to distill it further and work closely with the local Members of Parliament and grassroots advisors to see how we can adapt it for use in the local community.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: I just want to go back to the point of whether MND can increase the manpower for the surveillance team because I think that is the crunch at this point, the bottleneck where we do not have enough officers to do the surveillance to tackle the feeding.</p><p>My second point is: a lot of us have focused on culling and culling is actually not the solution. That is is problem: the more you cull, the more pigeons you have.

       " 'Ms Sun Xueling: I thank the Member for his two points. Firstly, I would encourage perhaps the Member to share with us where the hotspots are because I think that would be very helpful in allowing us to concentrate our manpower or the use of cameras and targeted patrols. Because if we know when the pigeon feeder normally comes out, it is easier for us to catch the pigeon feeder in action. So, I think information such as this from residents, from grassroots leaders and from the community will be very helpful in allowing us to be more effective in the way we conduct our enforcement.On the second point about increasing penalties, currently, pigeon feeders can be fined up to $500 per offence. So, I think we can put more of this information out. And I would also like to share with him that there was this high-rise littering/pigeon feeding pilot in Yio Chu Kang that was actually spearheaded by one of my colleagues. On the enforcement front, not only do they deploy cameras to basically enforce and find out who the pigeon feeders are, they also put up captured images of the offenders. So, I think it is helpful in creating community awareness. And they also work with the local Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to engage vulnerable and/or recalcitrant offenders. Because while we have our fines, and we enforce when we catch – as I mentioned, they can be fined up to $500 per offence – we also find that sometimes, some of these offenders may have some other issues that they are dealing with. And if we are able to work with the community, we can also reach out to the families and friends of these offenders and see how we can deter such behaviour from them.',\n",
       " 'Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast) Similarly, in my constituency, we have a lot of pigeon issues. So, I listened with great interest in the pilot that the Senior Parliamentary Secretary spoke about. All the things that Senior Parliamentary Secretary spoke about, we have attempted. And I would say, over the last eight or nine years, I do not see much results. We have done everything that she has suggested. I think the pilot that she just mentioned, I listened with great interest and I would like to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary when can this be rolled out to the other parts of Singapore.',\n",
       " 'Ms Sun Xueling: I thank the Member for the point she raised. The pilot consists of three parts. I had mentioned enforcement earlier. It also includes community solutioning which includes putting up educational materials which I am sure the Member has attempted. But also, I guess it is really about house-to-house visits for affected blocks. But I would say that the initial results from this high-rise littering/pigeon feeding pilot in Yio Chu Kang has been quite promising. We would look into it further and see how we can roll it out to different locations. As we understand it, pigeon feeding issues are quite local-based. It depends on the local infrastructure, the demographics of the residents who live in a certain area, certain habits, and the interaction between food centres in the local community.So, while we currently seem to have a pilot that has seemed to have worked quite well in Yio Chu Kang, I think we will probably have to distill it further and work closely with the local Members of Parliament and grassroots advisors to see how we can adapt it for use in the local community.',\n",
       " 'Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon): I just want to go back to the point of whether MND can increase the manpower for the surveillance team because I think that is the crunch at this point, the bottleneck where we do not have enough officers to do the surveillance to tackle the feeding.My second point is: a lot of us have focused on culling and culling is actually not the solution. That is is problem: the more you cull, the more pigeons you have. So, I am really hopeful that this pilot that the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned, we can roll out nationwide so that we can now effectively tackle this problem.',\n",
