This review was undertaken after LTA found distance discrepancies in 13 bus stop pairs after the launch of distance fares on 3rd July 2010.In this review, distance discrepancies were found in 68 bus stop pairs (about 1% of total bus stop pairs) which led to overcharging, and 30 bus stop pairs (about 0.45%) which led to undercharging. On a weekly basis about 6.9% of CEPAS cards were overcharged and 2.1% were undercharged. LTA and the bus operators have since apologised for the errors and for the inconvenience caused to commuters and have taken steps to refund commuters that were overcharged due to the distance errors.In response to commuters' feedback received on the old refund process, LTA has made improvements so that it is now faster and more convenient for affected commuters to get their refunds. Commuters can get a full refund on the spot and at their convenience at any TransitLink Add Value Machine (AVM), TransitLink Ticket Office or Concession Card Replacement Office which are available at most MRT stations, bus interchanges and selected bus stops. Commuters need not remember the bus service numbers, nor fill in any form. They only need to present their CEPAS cards to receive the refund if they are eligible for one.Senior citizens who are not familiar with the Add Value Machines can approach any TransitLink Ticket Offices with their cards. The staff at the Ticket Offices are trained to check the cards and refund the correct amount into their cards on the spot. To give commuters more time, a period of six months has been given for refunds. Affected commuters need not make a special trip and can get their refund when they next top up their cards. Unclaimed refunds will be contributed to the Public Transport Fund which will go to benefit needy families.Going forward, the Public Transport Council has put in place a framework to require bus operators to ensure that bus stop distances are updated correctly and on time following changes to the bus stop locations. Failure to do so could result in penalties.\",\n",

       "['The Second Minister for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) (for the Minister for Finance): Sir, the two Integrated Resorts (IRs) collect casino entry levies on behalf of the Totalisator Board.They also pay betting taxes and GST on their business receipts to the Government. However, the entry of the IRs has also led to a restructuring of the gaming industry as a whole.Hence, while the IRs have brought in new revenues, collections from other gaming activities such as lotteries, horse and sports betting, and fruit machines operated by clubs have fallen.Taken together, the net increase in collections by the Totalisator Board with the entry of the IRs was about $130 million in the eight months between April and November 2010.Likewise, the net increase in revenues to the Government with the entry of the IRs was about $420 million over the same period.The Totalisator Board will pool collections from the casino entry levies with their recurrent surpluses, which go towards funding activities benefiting the community.Just to recap, these range from educational and health programmes to sports and arts and culture.Some of Tote Board’s ongoing commitments include the Tote Board Social Service Fund, the Tote Board Community Healthcare Fund, the Yellow Ribbon Project and the Community Chest.The revenues collected by the Government from the IRs, like those from the rest of the gaming industry, flow into the Consolidated Fund.They are not earmarked for specific purposes, but go towards funding of the Government budget as a whole.This allows Government the flexibility to channel funds to areas with the greatest needs and strategic priority.']"
